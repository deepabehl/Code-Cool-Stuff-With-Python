## TRANSLATIONS 

Thanks for the interest in translating *Code Cool Stuff with Python*. 

Before you start translating a document you can first open a [pull request](https://github.com/purcellconsult/Code-Cool-Stuff-With-Python/pulls) to see if anyone has already started working on a translation in your language. 

If not then today is the day for you to spearhead the translation project!  Here are the steps to translating *Code Cool Stuff with Python*:

1)	Fork the repository. 
2)	Create a new branch for your translation. For example, if you’re translating the guide into German use `de`. 
3)	Translate the files in `/book`. 
4)	When you have at least the first chapter translated, go ahead and push it. For example, the path of the German translation repo should look like the following:   `Code-Cool-Stuff-With-Python/de/book`

Translating a book is a large project, so you’re more than welcome to break the process into parts. I’ll recommend working on a chapter at a time and then push what you got into the master branch. 

If someone has already started a translation project and you would like to contribute then go to the project page, open up an issue, and ask how you can contribute. Ideally, multiple translators can work on a single translation project in an organized state.
