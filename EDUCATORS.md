*Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for a Day. Teach a Man to Fish, and You Feed Him for a Lifetime.* 

Python is an excellent language for *coding-virgins*. It has an English-like syntax, a wide spectrum of applicability, and a large community which makes accessing online support trivial. By helping others learn how to code you can equip them with a skill set that could help them unlock the potential of computers. 

You also help deepen your mastery of coding and will be on the path to further enlightenment. I want to encourage others to get involved with spreading the knowledge of coding so you have my permission to use my course as a template for your teachings. The only caveat is that the teachings must be free. Hereâ€™s a prospective 5-week FAST TRACK course that you can offer.
